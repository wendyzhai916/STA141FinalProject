# STA141FinalProject

## About this Project

This project was a final project assigned in STA 141 (Fall 2021), offered in UC Davis. 

It was completed in collaboration with Kyung Lee and Paulo Rocha.

In this project, we utilized R to perform a multilinear regression analysis along with a clustering analysis to show that risk factors, such as the prevalence of current smokers, and socioeconomic status, such as educational attainment, may have a significant influence on heart attack mortality rate at the county level in the US.

The data for this study were retrieved from the CDC website.
